This repository contains various things and changes over time. Right now, it contains:

* in ownCloud/, a demo of how to get started with your own server.
* in rackspace/, the code of all the demo domains we host at rackspace. Note there are also demos on https://github.com/unhosted/unhosted.github.com/tree/master/demo
* in gd-proxy/, a (still broken!) experiment with GoogleDrive (now still called GoogleDocs-any-file) compatibility
