This repository contains various things and changes over time. Right now, it contains:

* in /ownCloud, a demo of how to get started with your own server.
* in /rackspace, the code of all the demo domains we host at rackspace

Setting up unhosted storage for your own user address
=============================
If you want to get started with Unhosted, try installing ownCloud on your domain. If your domain is me.com and your ownCloud user is called 'admin', then 'admin@me.com' will be your remote storage. Just make sure you install ownCloud in the root of the domain, so not in a subfolder (although subdomains are OK). If in doubt, drop by in our [chat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=unhosted).
