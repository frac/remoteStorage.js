This repository contains various things and changes over time. Right now, it contains:

* the code of all the domains we host on our demo server


Setting up unhosted storage for your own user address
=============================
If you want to get started with Unhosted, try installing ownCloud on your domain. If your domain is me.com and your ownCloud user is called 'admin', then 'admin@me.com' will be your remote storage.


Converting your web app to Unhosted
=============================
With our packager, you can easily take any localStorage-based app, and make it into an unhosted app. So if you have an application, then write it so that it stores all user data in localStorage. Then follow the steps in http://unhosted.org/teaser
